Count Leaf Nodes - https://bit.ly/3Lyh6kC

Problem Statement
You are given a Binary tree. You have to count and return the number of leaf nodes present in it.
A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child
A node is a leaf node if both left and right child nodes of it are NULL.

void inorder(BinaryTreeNode<int> *root, int &count)
{
        // base case
        if (root == NULL)
        {
                return;
        }

        inorder(root->left, count);

        // leaf node
        if (root->left == NULL && root->right == NULL)
        {
                count++;
        }

        inorder(root->right, count);
}

int noOfLeafNodes(BinaryTreeNode<int> *root)
{
        int cnt = 0;
        inorder(root, cnt);
        return cnt;
}
